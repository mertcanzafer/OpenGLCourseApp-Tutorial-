* My first Graphics engine in OpenGL. I've used GLFW lib for window I/O, and ASSIMP lib for importing 3d Models
* I followed Moder OpenGL tutorial teached by Ben Cook as well as reading contents from learn opengl website
* I thought that it's better to give a break for more opengl since currently I am interested in DirectX 11 api.
* However, I am going to return doing more advance topics using opengl api as long as I got enough knowledge from DirectX.
